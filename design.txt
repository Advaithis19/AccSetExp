// data structures
rsa accumulator
bitmap + hashmap (worse)
hashset
sorted list (worse)
(ds for permanent storage - 2D bitmap + array)

// workflows to experiment with
verify membership
insert
delete

// range
[2^7 - 2^20]

// experiments in isolation
prover time (create membership proof)

// misc
normal (fetch, produce) vs accum (fetch, produce)
